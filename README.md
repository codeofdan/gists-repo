# Hello World

Written to support my tutorial/blog post: http://codeofdan.com/2015/08/04/an-object-orientated-look-on-hello-world/

Simple Hello World application using object-orientated principles which will either print a greeting to the user via
stdout.

## Usage

From the root directory of the hello-world repository, run the following commands:

    $ cd src/main/java/
    $ javac hello/HelloWorld.java

The source has now been compiled and you can run it as so:

    $ java hello.HelloWorld
    Hello World!

An argument can be added to customise the greeting:

    $ java hello.HelloWorld Dan
    Hello Dan!
